# weather_forecast_slick 

Made from Bootstrap 3/ jQuery/ Ajax

A good weather forecast design with alot of APIs

You can see a clean version <a href ="http://codepen.io/Boyboi86/full/xVNyBd/">here</a>, there clean version doesn't have filter and no background picture to support any weather change. 

I personally like the clean version as is has more artistic feel to it.

The current version in this repositary supports weather change for background and icons used from weather-icons. Pleaase download it to see the full version.
